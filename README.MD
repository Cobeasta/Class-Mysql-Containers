# Containerized MySQL for Students

**Description**

A single line change allows creation of a new MySQL server containerized to run on any OS with Docker and a bash program (like git bash) installed. The new MySQL server can be connected using localhost on a port specified by the student with ease.

See the repository's wiki for further instructions.
